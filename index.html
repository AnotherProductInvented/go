# JavaScript Go

A simple implementation of the classic board game **Go** using JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. This project provides a two-player local game on a 19×19 board with basic rules including stone placement, capturing, the ko rule, suicide moves, passing turns, and end-game scoring.

## Features

- **Classic Rules:** Play Go with rules covering:
  - Stone placement on intersections.
  - Capturing enemy groups by removing their liberties.
  - Enforcing the ko rule to avoid board repetition.
  - Preventing suicide moves unless capturing opponent stones.
  - Passing turns to end the game.
- **Scoring:** Calculate territory, captured stones, and add a komi bonus (7 points) for White.
- **User Interface:** Intuitive overlays for the main menu, instructions, and game-over screen.
- **Responsive Controls:** Mouse and keyboard shortcuts (e.g., press [M] for menu and [P] to pass).

## How to Play

1. **Objective:**  
   Control more territory on the board than your opponent by surrounding empty intersections with your stones.

2. **Setup:**  
   - **Board:** 19×19 grid.
   - **Players:** Two players – Black (plays first) and White.
   - **Stones:** Players take turns placing stones on the intersections.

3. **Game Rules:**  
   - **Turn-based Play:** Place one stone per turn on an empty intersection.
   - **Liberties:** A group (connected stones horizontally or vertically) must have at least one empty adjacent intersection.
   - **Capture:** If a group loses all liberties, it is captured and removed from the board.
   - **Ko Rule:** Prevent moves that would recreate a previous board state.
   - **Suicide Rule:** You cannot play a move that results in your own stone or group having no liberties, unless it captures enemy stones.
   - **Passing:** Players can pass if no beneficial move is available. Two consecutive passes end the game.

4. **Scoring:**  
   - **Territory:** Count each empty intersection completely enclosed by a player’s stones.
   - **Captured Stones:** Each captured enemy stone counts as one point.
   - **Komi:** White receives a bonus of 7 points to balance Black's first-move advantage.
   - **Winning:** The player with the highest total score (territory + captured stones + komi) wins.
